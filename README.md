## Obtaining Diagnosis Data

Diagnosis ICD-10 codes can be extracted with

```
SELECT crm.concept_id, crt.code
FROM concept_reference_term AS crt
INNER JOIN concept_reference_map as crm
    ON crm.concept_reference_term_id=crt.concept_reference_term_id
WHERE crm.concept_map_type_id=2
    AND crt.code LIKE '___._'
GROUP BY crm.concept_id
INTO OUTFILE '/var/lib/mysql-files/bistenes-ciel-icd-3dig.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
```

Diagnosis names can be extracted with

```
SELECT cn.concept_id, cn.name, cn.locale, crt.code
FROM concept_reference_term AS crt
INNER JOIN concept_reference_map as crm ON crm.concept_reference_term_id=crt.concept_reference_term_id
INNER JOIN concept_name AS cn ON cn.concept_id=crm.concept_id
WHERE cn.locale IN ('en', 'es') AND crm.concept_map_type_id=2 AND cn.voided=0 AND crt.code LIKE '___._'
INTO OUTFILE '/var/lib/mysql-files/bistenes-pih-icd-3dig.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
```
